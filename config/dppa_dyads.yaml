# Inter-session comparison: All possible dyad pairs across all sessions
# Method: nsplit120 (120 equal epochs across entire recording)
# Output: Rectangular CSV per task (120 rows × ~1275 columns)

  method: nsplit120
  tasks:
    - restingstate

  compare: all  # All possible pairs (51 sessions choose 2 = ~1275 pairs)

# Intra-family comparison: Dyads within the same family and session
# Method: sliding_duration30s_step5s (overlapping 30s epochs every 5s)
# Output: Single CSV per task with dyad_id column (variable rows per dyad)

# Notes:
# - Inter-session: Compare all participants across all sessions
#   Example pairs: f01p01-ses01 vs f02p03-ses02, f03p05-ses01 vs f04p01-ses03, etc.
# - Intra-family: Compare participants within same family and session only
#   Example pairs: f01p01-ses01 vs f01p02-ses01, f02p03-ses02 vs f02p04-ses02, etc.
# - Both modes support multiple tasks (restingstate, therapy)
# - Dyad naming format: {participant1}-{session1}_{participant2}-{session2}
#   Inter-session: f01p01-ses01_f02p03-ses02
#   Intra-family: f01p01-ses01_f01p02-ses01
